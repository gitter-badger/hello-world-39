# hello-world
I remember everything.
From the moment i was born. Their faces and how they broke my collarbone.
By 10 i was able to recognize around 3 millions different types of perceptions.
Now i got everything. Material world does not exist. All is about energy that creates patterns that later becomes an environment known as a universe.
Time is liquid. There are neither past nor future. This story has no start and would never ends
