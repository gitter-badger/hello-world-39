I remember everything.
From the moment i was born. Their faces and how they broke my collarbone.
By 10 i was able to recognize thousands different types of perceptions.
Now, i've got everything. Material world does not exist. All is about energy that creates patterns that later becomes an environment known as a universe.
Time is liquid. There are neither past nor future. This story has no start and will never end.
